The ideia of the project is to apply the concepts learned in the "Intro to machine learning" course from kaggle.

## About the Model
The model used was the RandomForestRegressor present in scikit-learn. Because the course is just an introduction to machine learning, the dataset was selected thinking in just having numerical variables and no missing values. The ideia was just to make a simple project to see how it works - and it did pretty well.
